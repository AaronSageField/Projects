## Hi, I'm Sage ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Economics & CIS graduate with real-world experience as the lone data and ops analyst inside a regulated, four-person business.

I build solutions where none exist â€” HIPAA-compliant feedback tools, retention analytics engines, CRM automation, and strategic marketing pivots based on real cost modeling.

Hereâ€™s a sample of what Iâ€™ve done:

- **Retention Snapshot Tool** â€“ Python script for cleaning and unifying multi-carrier Excel data
- **CRM Auto-Tagger** â€“ GUI app that applies tags via CRM API to reduce hours of manual work
- **Feasibility Study** â€“ Strategic report analyzing why Google Ads campaigns weren't worth the spend
- **Feedback Web App** â€“ Firebase tool that encrypts feedback and boosts verified reviews by 950%

Open to roles in Minnesota or remote. My LinkedIn: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sage-field-7b6041369/)
