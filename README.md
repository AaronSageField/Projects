## About Me

Hi, I'm Sage Field.

I'm an Economics and Computer Information Systems graduate with hands-on experience as the sole data and operations analyst within a regulated, four-person Medicare agency.

I specialize in building solutions where none previously existedâ€”whether that means developing HIPAA-compliant feedback tools, designing retention analytics engines, automating CRM workflows, or reframing marketing strategies based on real cost modeling and statistical insight.

Some examples of my work include:

- The **Retention Snapshot Tool**, a Python-based solution that standardizes and unifies multi-carrier Excel data for retention analysis.
- A **CRM Auto-Tagger**, a GUI application that interacts with a CRM API to automatically apply workflow-specific tags, saving hours of manual effort.
- A **Feasibility Study** that restructured a flawed Google Ads proposal into a clear, cost-based argument against digital spend.
- A **Feedback Web App** built with Firebase that encrypts client responses and increased verified reviews by 950%.

I'm currently open to roles in Minnesota or fully remote positions.
